React frontend for Picopic, written in TypeScript.

This is a simple website that interacts with the Picopic backend.
It can be deployed basically anywhere as a static website.
Currently it is deployed to an AWS S3 bucket. The infrastructure
for that lives in the [picopic-frontend-infrastructure][1] project.
